## 22/06/2025 <br>
Did leetcode 7 questions today(contests 451,453,454,455)
Installed psql in wsl. <br>
Created a user.<br>
Tried creating a database, but didn't load anything in the terminal. <br>
Other commands like creating table, etc worked fine.<br>
Tried to fix the DATABASE issue, it seems some issue with the storage.<br>
Then tried to fix that, turns out wsl is in version 1.<br>
Tried updating but didn't work. Suggestions are to reinstall everything from scratch.<br>
(Using nano to edit these files, not vscode).

## 23/06/2025 <br>
Fixed the wsl issue.<br>
Had to login via admin and then change it in my user itself.<br>
"df -h" gives storage values which aren't constant.(I don't know why) <br>
Checked psql in wsl, it's working fine.<br>
Went through some tutorials on SQL in codecademy.com, familiar with basic tables, queries, functions like AVG, ROUND, GROUP, etc. <br
Will soon add a PSQL commands file. <br>
Doing multiple tables in SQL. <br>
Will give a codeforces contest tonight. (div2) <br>
Looked up on flask and django, will install them after contest.<br>, 
Gave the contest Educational Codeforces Round 180(Div2), could solve 1,2 correctly<br>
