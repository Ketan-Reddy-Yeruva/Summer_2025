Messed up with some git today.<br>
Finally it is working fine(in the windows command prompt)<br>
Still having some git login issues in using it from WSL (while using "git push")<br>
Did a very basic project (number_guesser).<br>
Will try out some other basic project tonight ig.<br>

<br>
Tried out some CP Questions.<br>
Couldn't solve some of them completely.<br>
Should review some CP concepts like sliding window, subsequence sums, etc<br>
