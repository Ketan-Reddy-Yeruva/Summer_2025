Messed up with some git today.<br>
Finally it is working fine(in the windows command prompt)<br>
Still having some git login issues in using it from WSL (while using "git push")<br>
Did a very basic project (number_guesser).<br>
Will try out some other basic project tonight ig.<br>
<br>
Tried out some CP Questions.<br>
Couldn't solve some of them completely.<br>
Should review some CP concepts like sliding window, subsequence sums, etc<br>

Installed PSQL today.<br>
Wasn't easy at all, took so long to do.<br>
After setting it up, looked up on PSQL Basics.<br>
Did a small table and understood how it works(very fundamentals)<br>
