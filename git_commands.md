Functions that I mostly use :<br>

**git status**<br>
This one is used to check the status of files which were modified, new files that were added
but not pushed yet.<br>
**git add** <br>
This is used in the following way : `git add <filename.format>`. We can use `git add .` to just add all the new files directly.<br>
**git commit -m "This is what I did"**<br>
This sends a message to the github repo on all your changes with the message that you've typed.<br>
**git push**<br>
This updates the changes done to the repo in your laptop to the github repo online.<br>
**git log**<br>
This gives the history of all the previous commits.<br>
**git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git** <br>
This is actually used to get the github repo installed in your laptop.<br>
