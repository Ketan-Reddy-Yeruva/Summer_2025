Reason : Using vim for the first time

Used the following commands.
touch filename.txt
	This created an empty text file, named filename.txt in the cureent directory.

vim filename.txt
	This opened the file in vim in the terminal itself.
	I have typed this document in vim.

cat filename.txt
	This command outputs all the contents of the file in the order as they are in the file.

Press the "Esc" key on the keyboard to enter command mode in vim.
Now you can use
	:w
		This command will save your changes.
	:q
		you will exit vim.
	i
		This will take you back to editting mode (you can make changes)
		(you will see ""-- INSERT --"" at the bottom left of the page while in editting mode.

I have now used the command
	nano filename.txt
This command opens the file using nano.
It is like vim, but it has a helpbox kindof thing at the bottom of the screen with a few visible commands.
